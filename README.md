## Coding 

Coding in various programming languages.  
I have ventured into various programming languages in my time.  
From "hello world" to learning and experimenting with the languages features and APIs.

I've open-sourced all my coding, so I can have a backup (basically no money for private Github repositories) and also in good faith that someone may find something useful here.  

## Copying
This repository master branch is just a manifest for [hgit](https://github.com/cswl/hgit) a tool I wrote to manage
multiple projects in a single git repository using orphan branches.

You can clone the whole project structure as it's in my hard disk with:
```bash
hgit clone https://github.com/cswl/coding.git
```
