Public Access Modifier
    The public access modifier allows full access to all members of the same package and full 
    access to members of other packages – basically everything.

Protected Access Modifier
    Protected access allows full access to all members of the same package – exactly like default access.
    In addition, access is granted to subclasses of another package through inheritance only.

Default Access (aka Package-Private) No-Modifier
    When no modifier exists in a declaration statement, then the default (aka package-private) access
    is applied. Default access allows full access to only members of the same package.
    
Private Access Modifier
    The private access modifier only allows access to code inside of the current class. 
    Packages are irrelevant when it comes to this access modifier.


Other Noteworthy Stuff
    Standard classes (outer) can only have either public or default access,
    they cannot be marked protected or private. 
    There is a common misconception that the access  level of a class (outer) somehow 
    controls the access level of its members. 
    For example, a default access level class can have a public method;
    a public subclass will inherit that public method from within the same package. 
    A class outside of the package can access the method through inheritance by 
    extending the public subclass or by simply creating an instance of the public subclass.
